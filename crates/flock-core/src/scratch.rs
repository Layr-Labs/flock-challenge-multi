//! Process-global pool for the prover's large transient `F128` buffers.
//!
//! Each prove allocates, faults in, and frees several 64–128 MB vectors
//! (the RS codeword, the round-2 fold outputs, the multilinear tail's
//! ping-pong scratch). The allocator returns such allocations to the OS on
//! free (`munmap`), so every prove re-pays soft page faults on first touch
//! and a single-threaded unmap on drop — a few ms per prove at m = 29 that
//! no kernel tuning can parallelize away.
//!
//! The pool recycles those buffers across phases and across proves: `take`
//! hands out a previously-used buffer when one with enough capacity exists,
//! `give` returns a buffer for later reuse. Contents are NOT cleared —
//! `take` has the same write-before-read contract as
//! [`crate::alloc_uninit_vec`].
//!
//! Steady-state retention is bounded by [`MAX_POOLED`] buffers (~640 MB for
//! the m = 29 prove set). Call [`clear`] to release everything to the OS,
//! e.g. after the last prove of a batch.
