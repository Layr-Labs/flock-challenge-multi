//! Binary Merkle tree over a selectable hash — SHA-256 (using four-way
//! hardware SHA interleaving on supported ARM and x86-64 targets) or BLAKE3.
//!
//! The choice is a *runtime* one, carried by [`HashKind`] and threaded
//! from the PCS parameters / Ligerito config down to the two primitives
//! ([`hash_leaf`] and [`hash_pair`]). Everything else in this module — tree
//! layout, path extraction, multi-proof assembly and verification — is
//! hash-agnostic: both hashes produce 32-byte digests, so the proof format is
//! identical either way and only the digest *values* differ.
//!
//! Dispatch granularity is one branch per *batch* of hashes — a whole level
//! run for BLAKE3, four nodes for SHA-256 — not per byte, so carrying the
//! choice at runtime costs nothing measurable.
//!
//! Layout for `num_leaves = 2^k` leaves:
//!   tree[0..num_leaves]                              = leaf hashes (level k)
//!   tree[num_leaves..3·num_leaves/2]                 = level k−1
//!   ...
//!   tree[2·num_leaves − 2..2·num_leaves − 1]         = root (level 0)
//!
//! Total nodes: `2·num_leaves − 1`. The flat layout keeps the tree contiguous
//! in memory for cheap Merkle-path extraction later.
//!
//! SHA-256 uses the [`sha2`] crate. On aarch64 with the `sha2` target feature
//! (set implicitly by `target-cpu=native` on M-series), the crate uses
//! `sha256h`/`sha256h2`/`sha256su0`/`sha256su1` ARM crypto extension
//! instructions; this is detected at runtime by [`cpufeatures`].
//!
//! BLAKE3 uses the [`blake3`] crate and BLAKE3's own tree semantics: a leaf is
//! a non-root chaining value, an internal node is a PARENT-flagged compression
//! of its two children. Both go through the crate's SIMD compression entry
//! point in [`BLAKE3_BATCH`]-wide calls, so the batch always fills the widest
//! vector the machine has (4 under NEON, 8 under AVX2, 16 under AVX-512) —
//! see the note above [`blake3_hash_many`] for why that API and how it is
//! kept honest.
//!
//! Which hash is faster is size- and target-dependent. On a target with the
//! ARM SHA-2 or x86 SHA-NI extensions, SHA-256 wins: its two compressions per
//! internal node run on a dedicated hardware unit, against BLAKE3's one in the
//! vector units. `benches/merkle.rs` measures both;
//! `benches/blake3_node_probe.rs` breaks the BLAKE3 side down per node shape.
//!
//! Domain separation differs between the two. BLAKE3's PARENT flag separates
//! leaf and internal pre-images inherently. The SHA-256 construction does
//! **not** — it has no leaf/internal tag, so it is open to second-preimage
//! attacks via interpretation collision, and a production PCS commit should
//! prepend `0x00`/`0x01` (or equivalent) before relying on it.

// BLAKE3 tree primitives.
//
// The BLAKE3 Merkle tree uses BLAKE3's *own* tree semantics rather than
// `blake3::hash` over concatenated bytes:
//
//   leaf   = Hasher::new().update(leaf_bytes).finalize_non_root()
//   parent = merge_subtrees_non_root(left_cv, right_cv, Mode::Hash)
//
// Two reasons. First, correctness: these are non-root chaining values, which is
// what interior tree nodes are supposed to be, and BLAKE3's PARENT flag gives
// leaf/parent domain separation for free — the property this module's header
// notes the SHA-256 construction lacks. Second, speed: both map onto BLAKE3's
// batched compression entry point, which is ~2× the scalar API (measured by
// `benches/blake3_node_probe.rs`).
//
// The two functions below are the *specification* — stable, public `blake3`
// API. The `blake3_hash_many_*` paths are optimizations that must agree with
// them bit-for-bit; `blake3_batched_matches_scalar_spec` in this module's
// tests is what holds them to it.
//
// NOTE — this deliberately differs from the sibling implementation on
// TomWambsgans/flock `blake3-pcs`, which defines a leaf as `blake3::hash(x)`
// and a parent as `blake3::hash(l ‖ r)` (root-flagged one-shot hashes). That
// contract is simpler and reproducible with plain `blake3::hash`; this one
// buys leaf/parent domain separation instead, which the SHA-256 construction
// lacks. The two produce *different digests* — a tree built under one does not
// verify under the other, so the choice has to be made once, project-wide.
// Both batch equally well, so it is not a performance trade.
